Window Server
Post-rendering and user-induced execution
After rendering has been completed, the browser executes JavaScript code as a result of some timing mechanism (such as a Google Doodle animation) or user interaction (typing a query into the search box and receiving suggestions). Plugins such as Flash or Java may execute as well, although not at this time on the Google homepage. Scripts can cause additional network requests to be performed, as well as modify the page or its layout, causing another round of page rendering and painting.

After these processes, the browser continues to manage the webpage's display, handling any user interactions that may require further updates or changes to the page. Additionally, the Window Server plays a role in managing graphical user interface elements, ensuring smooth rendering and interaction with the webpage.
